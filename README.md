# Customer-Segmentation-using-R
**Project Overview**
This project focuses on customer segmentation based on demographic and behavioral attributes using clustering techniques. The goal is to analyze customer data and identify distinct customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.

**Technologies Used**
Programming Language: R
Libraries: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, factoextra, cluster, dbscan
Clustering Methods: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN
Visualization Tools: ggplot2, fviz_cluster
 
**Project Workflow**
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, normalization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distribution and patterns.

**Clustering Analysis**
K-Means: Identified 4 customer segments based on spending behavior.
Hierarchical Clustering: Produced clusters but with less separation clarity.
DBSCAN: Detected noise points but struggled with distinct segmentation.

**Results & Insights**
Identified key customer groups for targeted marketing.
K-Means clustering provided the most actionable segments.

**Key Findings**
The dataset includes diverse customer demographics and spending behaviors.
K-Means clustering effectively grouped customers into distinct spending categories.
Hierarchical clustering showed some structure but lacked clear separability.
DBSCAN identified many noise points, indicating high data variability.
